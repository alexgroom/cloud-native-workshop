https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^] is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

=== Getting your Developer Workspace with a single click

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  will provide you an out-of-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job. **And with only one single click!**

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer Workspace'*`

[link={{ CHE_URL }}/dashboard/#/ide/user{{USER_ID}}/wksp-cloud-native]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::{% image_path developer-workspace-button.png  %}[Developer Workspace - Button, 300]

Then `*login as user{{USER_ID}}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}*`, `*click on 'Allow selected permissions'*` and let's the magic happens...

Once completed, you will have a fully functional Browser-based IDE within the source code already imported.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-openshift-connector[OpenShift Connector^]
is a Visual Studio (VS) Code extension for interacting with Red Hat OpenShift cluster with more improved features for a seamless developer experience.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-openshift-connector[OpenShift Connector^] on CodeReady Workspaces provides an end-to-end developer experience for interacting with a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. 
By leveraging the IDE features, developers can create, deploy, and debug applications and then deploy directly to 
the running OpenShift cluster.

=== Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift User

First, in your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*open the 'OpenShift' View*` by clicking on the OpenShift icon of the left hand side.

image:{% image_path che-openshift-view.png %}[Che - OpenShift View, 300]

Then, `*click the 'Log in to cluster' icon and confirm you want to connect to a different cluster*`

image:{% image_path che-openshift-login-popup.png %}[Che - OpenShift View, 500]

Finally, `*enter the following information*`:

.OpenShift Log in
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|Select the way to log in to the cluster.
|Credentials

|Provide cluster URL to connect.
|https://172.30.0.1:443

|Select username
|$(plus) Add new user...

|Provide Username
|user{{USER_ID}}

|Provide Password
|{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}

|===

You should see just 1 project in the **OpenShift View** as following:

image:{% image_path che-openshift-login.png %}[Che - OpenShift View, 300]

If you can see the **'cn-project{{USER_ID}}' project** it means you have logged into OpenShift correctly.

But you are missing a working project - the **Development Environment**. Let's create it!

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], from **'OpenShift' View**, 
`*right-click on the cluster URL and select 'New Project'*`

image:{% image_path che-openshift-new-project.png %}[Che - OpenShift New Project, 500]

Finally, `*enter the following information*`:

.OpenShift New Project
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|Provide Project name.
|my-project{{USER_ID}}

|===

'''

=== Log in to the OpenShift Developer Console

Now briefly moving away from the CodeReady Workspace IDE, lets see what our work so far has done from the 
OpenShift perspective.

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser.

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer Console'*`

[link={{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::{% image_path developer-console-button.png  %}[Developer Workspace - Button, 300]

`*Enter your username and password (user{{USER_ID}}/{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}})*` and 
then log in. After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. 

`*Select the 'Developer View'*` then your `*'my-project{{USER_ID}}'*` to be taken to 
the project overview page which will list all components that are part of your project. There's nothing 
there now, but that's about to change. 

If you see an *Access Error* when using the Developer View, it maybe you are trying to view the
'default' Openshift project which you do not have access to. Please use the Project drop down at 
the top of the page to select the 'my-project{{USER_ID}}' you just created.
