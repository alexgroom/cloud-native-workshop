== Reactive Microservices with Eclipse Vert.x

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about Eclipse Vert.x and how you can 
build microservices using reactive principles. During this lab you will 
create a scalable API Gateway that aggregates Catalog and Inventory APIs.

=== What is Eclipse Vert.x?

[sidebar]
--
image:{% image_path vertx-logo.png %}[Vertx, 400]

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] is a toolkit for building reactive applications on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Vert.x does not 
impose a specific framework or packaging model and can be used within your existing applications and frameworks 
in order to add reactive functionality by just adding the Vert.x jar files to the application classpath.

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] enables building reactive systems as defined by http://www.reactivemanifesto.org[The Reactive Manifesto^] and build 
services that are:

* *Responsive*: to handle requests in a reasonable time
* *Resilient*: to stay responsive in the face of failures
* *Elastic*: to stay responsive under various loads and be able to scale up and down
* *Message driven*: components interact using asynchronous message-passing

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] is designed to be event-driven and non-blocking. Events are delivered in an event loop that must never be blocked. Unlike traditional applications, Vert.x uses a very small number of threads responsible for dispatching the events to event handlers. If the event loop is blocked, the events won’t be delivered anymore and therefore the code needs to be mindful of this execution model.

=== Vert.x Maven Project 

The **gateway-vertx** project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the Vert.x project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

image:{% image_path vertx-gateway-project.png %}[Gateway Project,340]

This is a minimal Vert.x project with support for RESTful services. This project currently contains no code
other than the main class, *_GatewayVerticle.java_* which is there to bootstrap the Vert.x application. Verticles
are encapsulated parts of the application that can run completely independently and communicate with each other
using HTTP. Verticles get deployed and run by Vert.x in an event loop and therefore it 
is important that the code in a Verticle does not block. This asynchronous architecture allows Vert.x applications 
to easily scale and handle large amounts of throughput with few threads.All API calls in Vert.x by default are non-blocking 
and support this concurrency model.

image:{% image_path vertx-event-loop.png %}[Vert.x Event Loop,600]

Although you can have multiple, there is currently only one Verticle created in the *_gateway-vertx_* project. 

`*Examine 'GatewayVerticle' class*` in the **com.redhat.cloudnative.gateway** package in the **/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-vertx/src** directory.

[source,java]
.GatewayVerticle.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.gateway;


import io.vertx.core.Future;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.AbstractVerticle;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.Router;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.handler.StaticHandler;

public class GatewayVerticle extends AbstractVerticle { // <1>
    @Override
    public void start(Future<Void> future) { // <2>
        Router router = Router.router(vertx); // <3>

        router.get("/*").handler(StaticHandler.create("assets")); // <4>

        vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(router)
            .listen(Integer.getInteger("http.port", 8080)); // <5>
    }
}
----
<1> A Verticle is created by extending from *_AbstractVerticle_* class
<2> The *_start()_* method creates an HTTP server
<3> *_Router_* is retrieved for mapping the REST endpoints
<4> A REST endpoint is created for **/** to return a static HTML page **assets/index.html**
<5> An HTTP Server is created which listens on port **8080**

You can use Maven to make sure the skeleton project builds successfully. You should get a **BUILD SUCCESS** message 
in the build logs, otherwise the build has failed.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'Gateway - Build'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-gateway-build.png %}[Che - Catalog Build, 500]

Once successfully built, the resulting **gateway-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar** is located in the **/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-vertx/target/** directory.
This is an uber-jar with all the dependencies required packaged in the **jar** to enable running the application with **java -jar**.

=== Create an API Gateway

In the previous labs, you have created two RESTful services: Catalog and Inventory. Instead of the 
web frontend contacting each of these backend services, you can create an API Gateway which is an entry 
point for the web frontend to access all backend services from a single place. This pattern is expectedly 
called http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html[API Gateway^] and is a common practice in Microservices 
architecture.

----
<1> A REST mapping to map **/api/products** to the *_products()_* method
<2> Vert.x provides http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-service-discovery/java[built-in service discovery^] 
for finding where dependent services are deployed 
and accessing their endpoints. Vert.x service discovery can be seamlessly integrated with external 
service discovery mechanisms provided by OpenShift, Kubernetes, Consul, Redis, etc.
In this lab, since you will deploy the API Gateway on OpenShift, the OpenShift service discovery 
bridge is used to automatically import OpenShift services into the Vert.x application as they 
get deployed and undeployed. Since you also want to test the API Gateway locally, there is an 
*_onErrorReturn()_* method clause in the service lookup to fallback on a local service for Inventory 
and Catalog REST APIs.
<3> The *_products()_* method invokes the Catalog REST endpoint and retrieves the products. It then 
iterates over the retrieved products and for each product invokes the 
Inventory REST endpoint to get the inventory status and enrich the product data with availability 
info using the **getAvailabilityFromInventory()** method. Note that instead of making blocking calls 
to the Catalog and Inventory REST APIs, all calls 
are non-blocking and handled using http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rx/java[RxJava^]. Due to its non-blocking 
nature, the *_product()_* method can immediately return without waiting for the Catalog and Inventory 
REST invocations to complete and whenever the result of the REST calls is ready, the result 
will be acted upon and update the response which is then sent back to the client.
<4> The **getAvailabilityFromInventory()** method is similar to the **product()** method, it invokes the 
Inventory REST endpoint and retrieves the inventory.

=== Deploy on OpenShift

It’s time to build and deploy our service on OpenShift. 

OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/welcome/index.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^] 
feature can be used to build a container image from your project. OpenShift 
S2I uses the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_java_s2i_for_openshift[supported OpenJDK container image^] to build the final container 
image of the API Gateway service by uploading the Vert.x uber-jar from 
the **target** folder to the OpenShift platform. 

Maven projects can use the https://maven.fabric8.io[Fabric8 Maven Plugin^] to access the OpenShift S2I for building the application container image. 
This maven plugin is a Kubernetes/OpenShift client and uses the REST API to communicate with OpenShift and issue commands to build, 
deploy and launch the application as a pod.

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-gateway-deploy.png %}[Che - Gateway Deploy, 500]

[TIP]
.fabric8:deploy
====
It will cause the following to happen:

* The API Gateway uber-jar is built using Vert.x
* A container image is built on OpenShift containing the API Gateway uber-jar and JDK
* All necessary objects are created within the OpenShift project to deploy the API Gateway service
====

Once this completes, your project should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of 
the project in one or more pods which are the unit of runtime deployment and consists of the running 
containers for the project. 

'''

=== Test your Service

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Gateway Service*`

image:{% image_path openshift-gateway-topology.png %}[OpenShift - Gateway Topology, 700]

Your browser will be redirect on **your Gateway Service running on OpenShift**.

image:{% image_path gateway-service.png %}[Gateway Service,500]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
[ {
  "itemId" : "329299",
  "name" : "Red Fedora",
  "desc" : "Official Red Hat Fedora",
  "price" : 34.99,
  "availability" : {
    "quantity" : 35
  }
},
...
]
----

As mentioned earlier, Vert.x built-in service discovery is integrated with OpenShift service 
discovery to lookup the Catalog and Inventory APIs.

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
